## Design Principles

The architecture of the `ghost-ai-racing` project follows several key design principles:

1. **Modularity**: The project is divided into distinct modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application. This promotes separation of concerns and makes the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

2. **Scalability**: The design allows for easy addition of new features and components. For example, new AI algorithms can be added to the `ai/` directory without affecting existing functionality.

3. **Type Safety**: By utilizing TypeScript, the project ensures type safety across the codebase, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and improving code quality.

4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is provided to facilitate understanding and usage of the project. This includes both high-level architecture overviews and detailed descriptions of individual components.

## Future Enhancements

The architecture is designed to accommodate future enhancements, including:

- Integration with additional hardware components for improved AI capabilities.
- Expansion of the AI learning algorithms to incorporate more advanced techniques.
- Enhanced data analysis features to provide deeper insights into performance metrics.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the `ghost-ai-racing` project, ensuring that it is well-structured, maintainable, and ready for future development.
